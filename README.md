# Samantha Viewer ***(Super Sexy Mode)***

This project provides a web-based viewer for the Samantha 3D model, integrated with an AI chat powered by OpenWebUI. He has a super cool tail only on one side that wasn't an accident at all! :P

## Setup Instructions

1. Create an OpenWebUI instance.

2. Pull the Ollama model "sparksammy/samantha-super-s" or whatever model

3. Obtain your OpenWebUI host URL (must be public - Cloudflare tunnels recommended), OpenWebUI API Key (not the Pollinations one), and the name of the model you just created. Take note of them.

4. Update the `openWebUIEndpoint`, `apiKey`, and `modelName` variables in your `index.html` file accordingly.

5. Upload the folder to a web host!

6. Test it, and it ***should*** work. (Note: I am NOT taking any issues. Too lazy to fix bugs, I am.)
